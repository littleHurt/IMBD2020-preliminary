# IMBD2020-preliminary
This work is my submission for preliminary of [IMBD 2020](https://imbd2020.thu.edu.tw/) contest. 
The main task is to build a predictive module about the issue of intelligent manufacturing with data provided from the official. 
The training data and testing data were all uploaded to this repo, so did the document of my module. You could download test the result by yourself. 
My module can get 0.13 weighted RMSE from testinig data with specific weight which provided with the officia.
